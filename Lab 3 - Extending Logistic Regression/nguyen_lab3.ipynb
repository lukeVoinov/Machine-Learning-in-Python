    "## **1. Business Understanding**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this report, we will define the classification problem as predicting whether a driver will finish on the podium (top 3) in a given race based on pre-race and qualifying data from the Formula 1 World Championship (1950-2024) dataset from Kaggle. A value of 1 represents a podium finish (1st, 2nd, or 3rd place), while a value of 0 represents a non-podium finish (all other positions, including retirements or disqualifications). Features that may be used in the model include grid position, constructor (team), track characteristics, driver performance history, and season information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The business case for this type of model is centered on forecasting and strategic decision-making. Racing teams could use such a model to estimate the likelihood of a podium finish before the race to guide strategy, such as pit stop planning or driver expectations. Broadcasters and analysts could use the predicted probabilities to enhance pre-race coverage with data-driven insights, while sponsors and advertisers could use these forecasters to assess expected driver visibiliy and exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of model would be used primarily for offline analysis or pre-race forecasting, not for rela-time decision-making during a race. Because podium finishes are rarely rare events, the model does not need to achieve perfect accuracy to be valuable. Instead, its usefulness lies in performing better than a naive baseline (predicting \"no podium\"), providing some discriminative power to identify which drivers are more likely to place highly. Even a moderate level of accuracy would provide helpful insights for teams, broadcasters, and sponsors."

    "The Formula 1 results dataset contains data from many seasons and hundreds of races dating back from 1950s, which means the sample size is large enough to allocate 20% for testing without sacrificing too much training data. Using 80% of the data for training allows for the logisitc regression model to learn from a wide range of drivers, constructors, and circuits, while 20 provides a sufficiently large and diverse set for evaluating model performance on unseen races.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the dataset exhibits a moderate class imbalance, of which only 15% of the entires are podium finishes (top 3). By using stratified sampling, we ensure that both the training and testing sets preserve this natural imbalance. This makes our evaluation metrics more reliable and representative of real-world performance."

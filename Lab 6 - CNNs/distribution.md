# **Points & Work Distribution for Lab 6 -- Convolutional Neural Architecture**
2.5 points are distributed among the team members: Nimai, Emmanuel, Luke, and Tiffany. Some parts may overlap and may need more support from rest of team members. If one person is done with their part, they should be available to help out with other people's parts.

## **Preparation** [3 points]
[ ] **[1.5 points]** __Choose and explain what metric(s) you will use to evaluate your algorithm’s performance.__ You should give a detailed argument for why this (these) metric(s) are appropriate on your data. That is, why is the metric appropriate for the task (e.g., in terms of the business case for the task). Mention why the data is similar to CIFAR and CIFAR's excellent business case. Please note: rarely is accuracy the best evaluation metric to use. Think deeply about an appropriate measure of performance.
[ ] **[1.5 points]** __Choose the method you will use for dividing your data into training and testing__(i.e., are you using Stratified 10-fold cross validation? Shuffle splits? Why?). Explain why your chosen method is appropriate or use more than one method, as appropriate. Convince me that your splitting method is a realistic mirroring of how an algorithm would be used in practice. 
- Note: Above is same as previous lab (Lab 5 - Wide and Deep Networks, refer to Github)

    "[1 point] One idea (required for 7000 level students): Perform feature extraction upon the images using DAISY. Rather than using matching on the images with the total DAISY vector, you will instead use key point matching. You will need to investigate appropriate methods for key point matching using DAISY. NOTE: this often requires some type of brute force matching per pair of images, which can be computationally expensive. Does it perform better than not using key point matching? "
